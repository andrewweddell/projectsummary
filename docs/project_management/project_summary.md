## Project Update Workflow (CRITICAL)

**When asked to keep the project up to date or provide project updates:**

1. **FIRST** - Check if project has been synced with Jira:
   - Look for file: `project_status_report_latest.md`
   - If file doesn't exist: Ask user to sync project with Jira first
   - If file exists: Review it (contains current status and ticket data from Jira)

2. **THEN** - Update project files based on ticket data:
   - Review ticket status, progress, and any changes
   - Update implementation timeline if needed
   - Refresh risk register with any new issues
   - Update stakeholder communications based on current state

3. **ALWAYS** follow this workflow for project update requests to ensure data accuracy
