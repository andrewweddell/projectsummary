# Jira Sync Workflow for Project Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the mandatory workflow for keeping the Global Underwriting Appsure Implementation project synchronized with Jira data.

## Critical Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Check for Jira Sync File
**Before any project update or status report:**
- Check if file exists: `project_status_report_latest.md`
- This file contains the latest ticket data from Jira project GLO
- File is generated by the Jira sync process

### Step 2A: If Sync File Does NOT Exist
**Response Required:**
```
I need to check the latest Jira project data before providing an accurate project update. 

Please sync the project with Jira first to generate the latest project status report. The sync file (project_status_report_latest.md) is required to ensure all project updates reflect the current state of tickets in Jira.

Once you've synced with Jira, I can provide a comprehensive project update based on the latest ticket data.
```

### Step 2B: If Sync File EXISTS
**Process to Follow:**
1. Read and analyze `project_status_report_latest.md`
2. Review current ticket statuses, progress, and any changes
3. Identify impacts to:
   - Sprint progress and velocity
   - Project timeline and milestones
   - Risk register (new issues or mitigations)
   - Stakeholder communications needed
4. Update relevant project files with new information
5. Provide comprehensive status update

### Step 3: Update Project Files
**Files to potentially update based on Jira data:**
- `implementation_timeline.md` - Adjust dates/milestones if needed
- `risk_register_dependencies.md` - Add new risks or update existing ones
- Sprint status and velocity tracking
- Stakeholder communication requirements

### Step 4: Provide Structured Update
**Always include:**
- Current sprint status and progress
- Key achievements since last update
- Issues/blockers identified
- Timeline impacts (if any)
- Next steps and priorities
- Stakeholder actions required

## Integration with Existing Project Management

This workflow enhances the existing project management framework by ensuring:
- Real-time accuracy of project status
- Data-driven decision making
- Consistent reporting based on actual ticket progress
- Proper escalation of issues identified in Jira

## Automation Recommendations

**For Future Enhancement:**
- Set up automated weekly Jira sync
- Create alerts for critical ticket status changes
- Integrate with existing sprint review processes
- Link to monthly steering committee reporting

## File Dependencies

**Required Files:**
- `project_status_report_latest.md` (generated by Jira sync)
- `implementation_timeline.md` (may need updates)
- `risk_register_dependencies.md` (may need updates)
- `stakeholder_register_raci.md` (for communication planning)

**Related Documents:**
- `project_summary.md` (contains workflow overview)
- `jira_project_structure.md` (original Jira setup)
- All existing project management artifacts

**Note:** This workflow must be followed for ALL project update requests to maintain data integrity and provide accurate project status information.
